# 🏹 Hunt The Wumpus — OOP Game Project (Python + Java)
This is a Year 11 Software Engineering assessment project developed by Allan Luong. It is a turn-based adventure game implemented first in **Python using Pygame** and then **converted to Java** using an AI-based code translation tool.

## 🎯 Game Objective
Explore a cave system and hunt down the elusive Wumpus! Avoid traps like bottomless pits and teleporting bats while managing your limited arrows and rocks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Language | Frameworks / Tools     |
|----------|------------------------|
| Python   | Pygame, VSCode         |
| Java     | Swing, IntelliJ / Eclipse / VSCode |
| Tools    | draw.io, CodeConvert.ai, Git, GitHub |

## 🧩 Features

- Object-Oriented structure (Player, Wumpus, Room)
- Room-based cave navigation system
- Hazards: Bats, Pits, and the Wumpus
- Arrow shooting and rock throwing mechanics
- GUI for both Python (Pygame) and Java (Swing)
- AI-assisted Python → Java code conversion
- Well-commented code using industry practices

## ▶️ How to Run the Game

### 🐍 Python Version

1. Download or clone this repo:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hunt-the-wumpus.git

2. Install Pygame:
    pip install pygame
   
4. Open `HuntTheWumpus.py` in VSCode.
   
6. Run the game.

### ☕ Java Version — Setup Instructions for VS Code

> Make sure you have [Java JDK 17 or higher](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) installed.

1. **Install Required VS Code Extensions** (from Extension Marketplace):
   - ✅ Java Extension Pack *(by Microsoft)*
   - ✅ Debugger for Java
   - ✅ Java Test Runner
   - ✅ Language Support for Java™ by Red Hat
   - ✅ Maven for Java *(optional, if using build tools)*
   - ✅ Gradle for Java *(optional)*

2. **Run Instructions**
   - Open the `HuntTheWumpus.java` file in VS Code.
   - Click the green "Run" button or right-click > **Run Java**.
   - If assets are used (e.g., images), make sure they’re placed in the correct directory.

3. **Optional**
   - Install **Spring Boot Extension Pack** if experimenting with web backends.
   - Set `JAVA_HOME` in environment variables if not already configured.

## 🔐 Security Note

- The project does not store personal data.
- The comparison between Java and Python in terms of data safety is included in the documentation.

## 📈 Git Workflow

- Code was committed regularly after major feature updates.
- GitHub was used for version control, issue tracking, and file submission.
